Mechanism Description:

To ensure causal consistency, we needed to make sure we handle our clocks correctly for reads and writes.
For reads, we needed to check for consistency. If the local vector clock of a node reads lower (or earlier),
then the node's vector clock reading a value will broadcast to all nodes with the correct vector clocks for
the events that transpired that the local node missed. Once received, it will possess the correct events and
information, and will be able to fulfill the read request. For writes, we do not need to check for consistency,
since the write makes the node consistent. Writes could mean adding to our KVS, deleting from our KVS, or updating
one of the values from our KVS. For each write, however, we must increment our clocks before the execution to
account for the fact that an operation was done. We acknowledge the client that the write was fulfilled and
broadcast the operation and our updated clock to all correct nodes.

A replica can detect if other replicas are down when a view change is adminstered. A replica has 10 seconds
to respond to the view change PUT request. If it does not respond within 10 seconds, then that replica is considered down.
Every 10 seconds, when the replicas converge, a request will be sent to the replicas that are down to see if they are up and
get them to be consistent.
